# EasyStorageTracker - Ornella Del Vicario

## Project Overview
EasyStorageTracker is a Java-based storage tracking system designed to showcase the power of generics, bounded types, and wildcards. This system can store various types of items — from books and devices to perishable goods like food — and demonstrates how to use Java Generics to create flexible, type-safe storage units. Additionally, utility methods have been created for handling wildcards and bounded types.

## Features
- **Generics:** Create flexible and reusable storage units for any object type.
- **Bounded Types:** Handle items with specific constraints, such as perishable items that have expiration dates.
- **Wildcards:** Use wildcard methods for processing collections of different item types.
- **Utility Methods:** Helper methods for printing and checking items, especially useful for checking perishable goods.
